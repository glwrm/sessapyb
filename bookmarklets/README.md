# Bookmarklets
Bookmarklets are small pieces of Javascript code embedded into a browser bookmark. The ones currently existing are:
- Eruda – Allows you to inspect HTML, scripts, and other resources being used by the site, even without regular access to the dev tools.
- History Flooder – Fills up your history with the current site you are on.
- About:blank Embedder – Will open a link embedded in an about:blank tab, preventing it from showing up in your history
