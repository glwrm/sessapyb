# GoGuardian
GoGuardian is one of the many content filtering and monitoring sites, and it can monitor a lot of stuff.

## Accessible Source Code
You are able to access many of the files that GoGuardian uses, and here is a list of all of the ones that actually have accessible code:
 * https://asset.goguardian/asset.js
 * https://asset.goguardian/window.js
 * https://extension.goguardian/extension.js
 * https://localstorage.goguardian/xdLocalStoragePostMessageApi.js
 * https://localstorage.goguardian/xdLocalStorage.js

There are also two files, found in the session storage of any website:
- gg_policy.json
- gg_entities.json

All the code in these will be inside files in the "sourcecode" folder for easy access.
